# Pycon AU 2018
## Context Managers: You Can Write Your Own!

This repo holds all the code snippets from my presentation at Pycon AU 2018.

See the summary for my presentation here: https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45062-context-managers-you-can-write-your-own/.

I haven't included the speech itself in case FB doesn't want other people using their slide deck, but later on I might migrate the speech to a non-fb slide deck and upload it here 😀😀😀🐍🐍🐍.
